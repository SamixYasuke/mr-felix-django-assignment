- **Product Catalog:** An organized and visually appealing catalog for displaying products with detailed information.
- **Shopping Cart:** Seamless integration of a shopping cart system for users to manage their selected items.
- **Checkout Process:** A secure and straightforward checkout process for completing transactions.
- **Database Integration:** Leveraging Django's ORM for efficient database management and storage.

## Development Stack

- **Django Framework:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django ORM:** An object-relational mapping system that simplifies database interactions.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for the backend logic.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap:** For creating the frontend views and enhancing user interactivity.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section of the README file. The `manage.py` script provides essential commands for running the development server, applying migrations, and managing administrative tasks.

## Why Django?

Django's batteries-included philosophy, coupled with its robust and well-documented features, makes it an ideal choice for developing scalable web applications. The project adheres to best practices in Django development, ensuring maintainability and readability of the codebase.

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a structured approach, with modular components for easy navigation and maintenance. Key components include models for database representation, views for handling user requests, and templates for rendering HTML pages.

## Contribution 

Contribution was mainly in groups in our group we split our selves in groups to be able to get things done faster as it was a different group that coded that handled documentation in order for everone to be useful we enforced that behaviour.
